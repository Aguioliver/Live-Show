Dino - I've Had The Time Of My Life


I've been waiting for so long Now I've finally found 
someone to Stand by me     
                                                  
We saw the writing on the wall As we felt this magical     
Fantasy 
      
Now with passion in our eyes There's no way we could 
disguise it Secretly    
     
So we take each other's hand 'Cause we seem to understand 
The Urgency   (Just remember)
     
You're the one thing I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something  This could be love because

[Refrão]
                          
I've had the time of my life No I never felt this way 
before
Yes I swear it's the truth And I owe it all to you

(Hey, baby!)

[Segunda Parte]
                                       
With my body and soul I want you more than you'll ever 
know
So we'll just let it go Don't be afraid to lose control       
Yes I know what's on your mind When you say "Stay with me
Tonight." (Just remember)

[Ponte]
                  
You're the one thing I can't get enough of
So I'll tell you something   This could be love because

[Refrão]
                         
I've had the time of my life No I never felt this way 
before

Yes I swear it's the truth And I owe it all to you
Cause I've had the time of my life
And I've searched through every open door
Till I found the truth And I owe it all to you
                              
Now I've had the time of my life No I never felt this way 
before (Never felt)
Yes I swear it's the truth And I owe it all to you
                        
I've had the time of my life No I never felt this way 
before (Never felt this way)
Yes I swear it's the truth And I owe it all to you
Cause I've had the time of my life
And I've searched through every open door
Till I found the truth And I owe it all to you
