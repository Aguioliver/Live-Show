Dino Fonseca - It Must Have Been Love

[Intro] B

Lay a whisper, on my pillow
Leave the winter, on the ground
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence
In the bedroom, and all around

Touch me now
I close my eyes
And dream away, ohhh

It must have been love, but it's over now
It must have been good, but I lost it
Somehow
It must have been love, but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time
Had run out

Make-believing, we're together
That I'm sheltered, ohh by your heart
But in and outside, I've turned to water
Like a teardrop, in your palm

And it's a hard
Ohh winter's day
I dream away

It must have been love, but it's over now
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living

Without

It must have been love, but it's over now
It must have been good, but I lost it
Somehow yeehh

[Solo] B  

It must have been love, but it's over now
It must have been good, but I lost it
Somehow
It must have been love, but it's over now
From the moment we touched till the time
Had run out

Yeah, it must have been love, but it's over
Now
It was all that I wanted, now I'm living
Without ohhhh

It must have been love, but it's over now
It must have been good, but I lost it
Somehow

Yeeh yeeh
