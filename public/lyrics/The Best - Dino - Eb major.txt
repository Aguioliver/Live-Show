   D#
I call you when I need you
                   D#6 D#7M D#
My heart's on fire

You come to me

Come to me wild and wild

[Pré-Refrão 1]

Give me everything I need

[Segunda Parte]

Give me a lifetime promises
                      D#6 D#7M D#
And a world of dreams
         
Speak a language of love
                            D#6 D#7M D#
Like you know what it means

          D#
In your heart I see the star
                             D#6 D#7M D#
Of every night and every day
        
In your eyes I get lost
                  D#6 D#7M D#
I get washed away
         Cm
Just as long as I'm here in your arms

I could be in no better place

My heart and my soul
